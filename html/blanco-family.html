        <h1>Blanco Family</h1>
        <h3><span>A Family of Painters</span></h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="lead">When God, in His infinite goodness, showered blessings on earth, there must have been an abundance that fell upon the small town of Angono, in the province of Rizal. Angono, through many decades, has continuously produced individuals with artistic talents with the likes of Botong Francisco, Lucio San Pedro, Perdigon Vocalan and Nemi Miranda.</p>

        <p>Parenthetically, on that day that there was a heavenly shower, a great chunk dropped on the 1,200 square meter property of the Blanco Family at the town proper. And with great appreciation, the family of nine accepted and put to good use their exceptional God- given talent for painting. </p>
        <br>
        <p>All 9 members of the Blanco family are standout painters. From the patriarch down to the youngest, they have gained fame and admiration nationwide and in other parts of the world.  And they share their skills in the brush through their well-arranged gallery showcasing their impressive and award winning works of art.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The father, Jose, better known as Pitok, started it all.  Greatly influenced by Botong Francisco, Pitok took to the brush as he had formal education in the field of arts. His father being a fisherman, he would tag along as he became acquainted with the day to day activities at the nearby Laguna de Bay.  His paintings focus mostly on the lake and its bounty, on rural scenes and on historical and cultural events.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Notable among Pitok's works is his adaptation of a scene in Jose Rizal's Noli Me Tangere.  Pitok painted on canvass Piknik sa Lawa. Another outstanding piece is the fluvial procession traditionally held during the town's annual fiesta celebration. About a hundred faces of Angono folks can be seen watching the colorful event.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Pitok's awesome works and achievements inspired his seven children, namely, Glenn, Noel, Michael, Joy, John, Gay and Peter Paul to take hold of the brush and express themselves on canvass.  And they are skilled painters in their own right. The mother, Loreto, is a great painter, too.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Viewing their impressive works at the family gallery gives one the impression that the Blancos are a close knit family guided by time-honored Filipino values.  And they continue to be thankful for their extraordinary skills.  As Pitok, who passed away several years ago, inscribed in one of his framed works:  " I am just a brush in the hand of the Lord, without His guidance, I can paint nothing."   Well said.  </p>
